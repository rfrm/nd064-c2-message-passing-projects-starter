I created three new services:

* location-consumer
* location-grpc
* person-grpc

The location-consumer service responsibility is to consume vast amounts of
real-time location events coming from Kafka and insert them in the Postgres database.

Kafka acts as a scalable messaging queue capable of ingesting thousands of location 
events per second coming from different places in the world. The architecture scales 
by increasing the number of location-consumer instances and increasing topic partitions.

The person-grpc responsibility is to decrease the load on the API service by handling all
person creation. The API service communicates with it via gRPC to guarantee fast data
exchange.

The location-grpc service provides a performant way for mobile apps to send their location
data.
